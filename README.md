### Introduction
Serve-My-Code API lets you host your app's code on GitHub Repositories (including Private) and access them directly from your app, thereby providing security to the code.

&nbsp;

### Features or Advantages
1) The important code stays online, i.e., the local app is just an empty shell.
2) The app stays always updated. Updates are required only when the shell requires an update.
3) Provides extra layers of code security.
4) Reduces chances of modding, altering the code, hacking the software.

&nbsp;

### Currently, it is available for NodeJS only.

&nbsp;

### Prerequisites
1) GitHub Account and Repositories
2) A token with read-only permissions to your respective repository.
3) A Code Editor, e.g, VSCode.

&nbsp;

### Registration
